We Finally Launched FamFunTrivia.com! (It only took forever...)

Well, well, well… look who finally got around to launching their website! That’s right—FamFunTrivia.com is officially live! It only took slightly less time than it takes to get a toddler to eat a green bean. 😅

![]({{ page.header.teaser }})

This site is your one-stop-shop for all things Family Fun Trivia: our family-friendly podcast, our laugh-out-loud YouTube channel, and (eventually) even some cool printable trivia games for when screen time needs a break.

If you’re new here, welcome! We make trivia that's safe, silly, and actually fun for the whole family. Think: brain-boosting questions, groan-worthy dad jokes, and zero chance of hearing anything you'd have to explain to your 8-year-old later. (“No sweetie, that word isn’t in your dictionary.”)

Oh, and speaking of dad jokes…

    Q: Why did the trivia team bring a ladder?
    A: Because they were going to high-level questions.

You're welcome.

We’re also growing like a middle schooler after a summer growth spurt, so now’s a great time to jump in and say you were here before it was cool. Subscribe to our YouTube channel for new episodes, bonus content, and surprise guests (spoiler: mostly us). And if you're feeling extra generous, Patreon is where you can help support the show and score some exclusive goodies.

The best is yet to come. So buckle up, trivia fans—it’s going to be a fun ride (seatbelt optional if you're sitting on the couch).

🎉 Thanks for being part of the fam!
