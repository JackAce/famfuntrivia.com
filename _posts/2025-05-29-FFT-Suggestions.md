## ðŸš€ Suggest a Trivia Question (or Three)!

![]({{ page.header.teaser }})

Big news from the Family Fun Trivia HQ: we're officially opening the floor to your brilliant, hilarious, and maybe slightly sneaky trivia question ideas! ðŸ§ âœ¨

Whether your kid just asked a question that stumped the whole family, or youâ€™ve been holding onto a perfectly punny multiple-choice gem, we want to hear it. Our show is all about curious minds and creative questionsâ€”and who better to contribute than you?

Weâ€™ve set up a handy-dandy [suggestion form](https://forms.gle/1dPcA6FGpZNmZf9N6) for you to send us your trivia ideas. Got a cool fact about space? *A weird animal?* *A mind-blowing science tidbit that makes adults say "Whaaaat?"* Perfect. That's what weâ€™re looking for.

Want more details on what makes a good submission? Visit our full directions page
[here](/contact/suggestions/)!

We can't promise we'll use every submission, but if we love yours, we just might include it in an upcoming episodeâ€”and give you a shoutout on the show! (And if your trivia question causes your parents to do a spit-take during breakfast, well, thatâ€™s just a bonus.)

So go ahead, give it your best shot. The only wrong trivia questionâ€¦ is the one you never submit.

Thanks for helping us make Family Fun Trivia smarter, sillier, and more surprising with every episode.

Now get crackin'!
(But no pressure. This isn't Egghead Jeopardy... yet.)
