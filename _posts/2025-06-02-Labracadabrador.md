🐾 What Kind of Dog Does a Magician Have?

A LABRACADABRADOR! 🎩✨🐶

He’s got floppy ears, a wagging tail, and the ability to vanish right when
it’s bath time. This magical mutt pulls tennis balls out of top hats and makes
your sandwich disappear in a single gulp. If you love silly puns, lovable dogs,
and a little abracadabra, you’re going to love what we whipped up…

🧠 Wait… What’s JackAce.com?

Our [merch store](https://shop.jackace.com/collections/kid-friendly) lives
under a bigger brand called JackAce.com — a site that also includes strategy games
and products for grown-ups. But don’t worry: the link above leads only to our
Kid-Friendly Collection, where everything is family-approved and safe for young
fans of the Family Fun Trivia podcast.

No tricks, just treats!

## 🐶 Final Act?

Tell the joke to your friends. Watch them groan, laugh, and then ask,
“Wait… do they really sell Labracadabrador shirts?!”

✨ [Yes. Yes, we do](https://shop.jackace.com/collections/kid-friendly).
