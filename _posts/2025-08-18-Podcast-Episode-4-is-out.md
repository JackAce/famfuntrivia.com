[Episode 4](https://open.spotify.com/episode/45EGJZKPB1ID2erY9llTDd)
of the Family Fun Trivia Podcast is here! 🎉

![]({{ page.header.teaser }})

This week’s episode is packed with five brand-new trivia categories:

* 🚗 Cars – From speedy racers to everyday rides.
* 🥦 Vegetables – Yes, broccoli makes an appearance!
* 🔵 The Color Blue – All about the coolest color in the crayon box.
* ➗ Math – Don’t worry, we keep it fun.
* 🌌 Star Wars – May the trivia be with you.

You can watch the episode right now on YouTube or listen on Spotify (links coming soon!). Whether you’re a car enthusiast, a veggie lover, or a Jedi in training, there’s something here for everyone in the family.

👉 And good news—the Episode Guide on our website has also been updated so you can track all the categories we’ve covered so far.

Of course, it wouldn’t be a Family Fun Trivia blog without a few dad jokes:

> Why did the math book look so sad?
>
> Because it had too many problems.

> What do you call a vegetable that’s always getting promoted?
>
> A “cauli-flour.” 🌸

> Why don’t Jedi ever use the internet?
>
> Too many “Sith”-y pop-ups.

So grab some snacks, gather the family, and put your trivia skills to the test. And remember—don’t forget to like, subscribe, and share to help us keep the fun rolling.
