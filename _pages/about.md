Welcome to *Family Fun Trivia* — the kid-friendly podcast and YouTube channel that turns car rides, rainy days, and snack breaks into laugh-out-loud learning sessions!

We created FFT because we wanted something *smart*, *silly*, and *safe* that families could actually enjoy together. Think science, space, animals, history, and yes... **bad dad jokes** so groan-worthy, they should probably come with a warning label.

> Why did the computer go to art school?  
> Because it had too many bytes and needed to draw the line somewhere. 😎

Whether you're 7 or 70, we've packed our episodes with fun facts, playful questions, and just enough corny humor to keep parents chuckling and kids rolling their eyes.

So kick back, press play, and let us bring the trivia party to you. No subscriptions required. Just curiosity, laughter, and maybe a snack or two.

Thanks for stopping by — we’re glad you're here! 🚐✨
