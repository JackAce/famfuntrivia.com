## 🧠 Got a Great Idea? Let’s Hear It!

Welcome to the official Family Fun Trivia suggestion page! This is where YOU get to help shape the show. Whether you’ve got a wild trivia fact, a silly joke, a birthday shoutout, or just want to hear your name on the air—we want to know!

Click here to jump straight to the form:
[👉 Submit Your Idea!](https://forms.gle/1dPcA6FGpZNmZf9N6)

The form is short and sweet, just like our host before coffee. Here’s what it includes:

* Name – So we know what to call you (other than “mysterious genius”).
* Can we say your name on the show? – Some folks like the spotlight, others prefer the ninja route.
* Are you a Patreon supporter? – We LOVE our Patrons! They get high-fives and occasional trivia superpowers.
* What kind of suggestion is it?
  - You’ll choose from:
  - 🎉 Birthday or shoutout
  - 😄 Joke
  - 🤓 Trivia category
  - ❓ Full trivia question
  - 💡 Or something totally different!
* The Suggestion Box – This is the magic space where your idea goes. Type away!

## Tips for a Great Suggestion:

* Keep it family-friendly (remember, Grandma might be listening!)
* Fun facts > boring facts ("Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren’t?" Now that’s a winner!)

If we use your suggestion, we might give you a shoutout on the show! If not, we still think you're awesome for trying.

So what are you waiting for?
Go submit something before the dog eats your idea!
